# C.A.L.M.

C.A.L.M. is our entry for the Brackeys 2024.2 game jam, which had the "Calm before the storm" theme and a 7 day time limit. This repository contains all of the game's assets.

## Description

Our game is a third person exploration game where you must gather up scrap pieces from the stormy wasteland in order to upgrade your ship, the Crazy Apocalyptic Levitation Machine. The player has to quickly collect the scrap, since the storm causes damage to the ship, while also avoiding bumping into obstacles and evading the cloud enemies.

## Playing

If you wish to play the game, there is both a WebGL, as well as a Windows version available on [itch](https://alexturculet.itch.io/calm).

## Installation

If you wish to download the project and mess with it, you can easily clone the repository, but you will require a Unity install. The project was created on Unity version 2022.3.22f1 and we do not guarantee it will work on other versions. You are free to use any of our graphical assets or code for your projects, but keep in mind that the background music is not made by us. Also, the volumetric clouds are taken from [here](https://github.com/Parrot222/Clouds-URP).
